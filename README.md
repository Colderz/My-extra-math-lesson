"**JaKorepetytor**" is an application useful for anyone who, like me, gives private lessons / tutoring. 
The application is a kind of students' notebook with the possibility of recording a specific feature of students, which is their level.
By saving the amount and displaying everything in an intuitive and clear view, we will be able to read the information as soon as possible.
