"**JaKorepetytor**" is an application useful for anyone who, like me, gives private lessons / tutoring. 
The application is a kind of students' notebook with the possibility of recording a specific feature of students, which is their level.
By saving the amount and displaying everything in an intuitive and clear view, we will be able to read the information as soon as possible.

# Under the hood

The main purpose of the application, in addition to facilitating the personal enrollment of students, was to practice messages related to RecyclerView, RecyclerAdapter and to a large extent complete understanding - Google Firebase (Realtime Database).

The whole was completed by custom dialog, bottom bar with a floating button and gesture support (swipe left and right)
